# NYC Subway Stations API

This is a read-only API which provides a static JSON response containing data
for subway stations in New York City. I started with a [CSV file from MTA's
developers page](http://web.mta.info/developers/data/nyct/subway/StationEntrances.csv),
which I distilled to obtain only the data I needed to support my project. The
sole purpose of this API is to support one of my Udacity Front-End Web Developer
Nanodegree projects. I decided to construct my own API to provide data rather than
hardcoding info into my front-end ViewModel.
